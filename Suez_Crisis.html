		<h3>Egypt Seizes the Canal</h3>
		<p>The Suez Canal is situated in Egypt, and connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. Since the canal was operated and owned jointly by the British and French it proved to be a convenient route for ships which transported supplies to Britain. <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/suez-crisis/"> (Suez Crisis) </a></p>
		<p>The Canal saved a lot of time and money for the British. However, on 26 July 1956 the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/egypt-nationalizes-the-suez-canal"> Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser </a> took over the Suez Canal and claimed it for Egypt.</p> 
		<h3>Israeli, French and British Aggression</h3>
		<p> The actions of Egypt troubled Israel, Britain and France. The Arab nations had severely hostile relations with Israel (a new country back then) and Egypt's president wanted to collect tolls from ships accessing the Canal, meaning severe impacts on the British and French economies. This feeling of insecurity forced Israel to attack Egypt, and Britain and France joining in later. <a href= "http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/suez_01.shtml"> (BBC)</a></p>
		<h3>Russia and the United States </h3>
		<p> The United States government was furious with their allies (Britain, France and Israel) as they invaded Egypt without the decision of the U.S. On the other hand, Russia vowed to use nuclear missiles and support the Egyptian military if the troops of Britain, France and Israel were not removed. The U.S warned Russia of retaliation if the allies of the U.S were attacked. All of these aggressive actions scared the global population and tensions of a Nuclear war increased. <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/suez-crisis"> (Cold War-Suez Crisis)</a></p>
		<h3> The Solution and the Aftermath </h3>
		<p> With all this tension surrounding the worlds two superpowers, there seemed to be no solution. However, Lester B. Pearson (back then the Canadian Minister of External Affairs) ended up being the shining light of hope. Mr. Pearson went to the United Nations and devised a plan that would solve the conflict. His idea was to make British, French and Israeli soldiers leave and instead occupy the area of conflict with a multinational force to keep peace and avoid conflict. This plan was excellent and ended up saving the world from another global war. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP15CH1PA3LE.html"> (Suez Canal Crisis)</a></p>
		<p> Lester B. Pearson with his great efforts showed that Canada could act as a middle power to solve international conflicts. He showed the world the new form of conflict resolution called &lsquo;Peace Keeping&rsquo;. Mr. Pearson was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for his contributions on ending the Suez Crisis. He is still remembered in Canada as well as other countries around the world for his noble actions. <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lester-bowles-pearson/"> (Lester B.
