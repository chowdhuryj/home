		<h2>What is my superpower?</h2>
		<p>The superpower that I have is invisibility. This superpower is a rare ability possessed by a very small amount of people, animals and aliens who are highly determined to not be seen. Famous fictional characters such as Harry Potter and Iron Man have worn suits or cloaks to become invisible however, I do not need such accessories to do this.</p>
		<h2>How I obtained my superpower</h2>
		<p>I first discovered my superpower when I was a student of grade seven at my middle school. One day I was trying to get away from a friend who was asking me extremely awkward questions. I did not want to participate in the conversation so, to avoid my friend I hastily walked into a large crowd and very quickly I was out of his sight. For the rest of the day I did the same thing to avoid him and it had worked perfectly. I had mastered invisibility just after a few months from when this incident had taken place.</p>
		<h2>Usage of my superpower</h2>
		<p>In middle school I used my superpower whenever I wanted to. I did this just to annoy or make fun of people. However, as I grew up I realized that I should be responsible with my superpower and use it only when in need. Currently I use my power only in rough situations. For example, I used my power last week to avoid someone whom I owed some money. I payed them back later. Overall, I feel great while using my superpower. My superpower is immensely beneficial and I would never give it up.</p>
